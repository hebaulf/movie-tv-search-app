# Javascript/React - Movie Search App

For this project I created a movie search app using API from [TMDB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/)

- The project is set up with [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started).
- I use react [prop-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types) for typechecking
- I use [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics) for styling.
- Project is deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
- Code is commented so you can see what each part is doing.
