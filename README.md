# Javascript/React - Memory Game

For this project I created a movie search app using API from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

- The project is set up with [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started).
- prop-types
- 
- I use styled-components for styling.
- Project is deployed using Vercel.
- Code is commented so you can see what each part is doing.
